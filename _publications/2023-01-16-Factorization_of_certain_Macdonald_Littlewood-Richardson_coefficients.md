excerpt: 'We find and prove a factorization formula for certain Macdonald Littlewood-Richardson coefficients \(c^{\nu}_{\lambda\mu}(q,t)\). Namely, we consider the case that the Kostka number \(K_{\mu, \nu-\lambda}\) is 1. This settles a particular case of a more general conjecture of Richard Stanley. This conjecture proposes that a factorization formula exists whenever the corresponding regular Littlewood-Richardson coefficient \(c^{\nu}_{\lambda\mu}\) is 1.'
